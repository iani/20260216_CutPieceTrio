/*
Here's **"Yume no Kakera" (夢のかけら — Fragments of a Dream)**, a complete J-Pop piece for SuperCollider.

**To run it:** Boot your server (`s.boot;`), then select all and hit `Cmd+Return` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Return` (Windows/Linux).

**What's in it:**

- **4 custom SynthDefs** — a sparkly glockenspiel-style bell lead, a lush detuned saw pad, a punchy sub bass, and a full drum kit (kick, snare, hi-hat)
- **Classic J-Pop chord progression** — I → V → vi → IV in A major (the backbone of countless J-Pop hits)
- **A-major pentatonic melody** over 4 bars, cycling for 8 bars total
- **Reverb send bus** via FreeVerb for that dreamy, polished J-Pop sheen
- Eighth-note hi-hats, bass on beats 1 & 3 with a slight octave jump on beat 3 for groove

Feel free to tweak the `bpm`, `numBars`, or `melody` array to customise it further!
